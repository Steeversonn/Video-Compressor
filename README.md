-Install FFMPEG and add it to PATH
-Copy the code to a text file, change the .txt to a .bat
-Store the .bat file in a folder that you want the compressed video to be stored, then create a shortcut to the batch file and put it wherever you want. Slapped mine on my desktop

-To use it, first copy the path to your video to clipboard by highlighting it, then pressing CTRL+SHIFT+C
-Run the batch file via the shortcut you made
-Once complete, the sub 10MB video will be stored alongside the main batch file.
